# Dynamic Pricing

A game company gave gift coins to its users for purchasing items in a game. Using these virtual coins, users buy various vehicles for their characters. The game company did not specify a price for an item and provided users to buy this item at the price they wanted. For example, for the item named shield, users will buy this shield by paying the amounts they see fit. For example, a user can pay with 30 units of virtual money given to him, while the other user can pay with 45 units. Therefore, users can buy this item with the amounts they can afford to pay.
