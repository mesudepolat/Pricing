# Dynamic Pricing

A game company gave gift coins to its users for purchasing items in a game. Using these virtual coins, users buy various vehicles for their characters. The game company did not specify a price for an item and provided users to buy this item at the price they wanted. For example, for the item named shield, users will buy this shield by paying the amounts they see fit. For example, a user can pay with 30 units of virtual money given to him, while the other user can pay with 45 units. Therefore, users can buy this item with the amounts they can afford to pay.

## Problems to be solved

1. Does the price of the item differ by category? Express it statistically.
* Depending on the first question, what should the item cost? Explain why?
It is desirable to be flexible in terms of price. Create a decision support system for the price strategy.
Simulate item purchases and income for possible price changes.
